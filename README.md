# title
Heal the World by Michael Jackson
# project overview
I chose that song because of its meaning and how clear it
really is. Also, I think the other lyrics in the song were good as well but this part was important for me because I liked how the words involved everyone. It is the message
of communities coming together because we are just regular human beings.
# technical overview
The lyrics appear like fade in and out for the transitions. 
The animation is blue and green lyrics with a light brown background. For the transformation, the lyrics appear slanted
across then slant down.
